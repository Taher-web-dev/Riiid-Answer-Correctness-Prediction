# Kaggle project  : Riiid-Answer-Correctness-Prediction
Kaggle  competition, which challenge us to create algorithms for "Knowledge Tracing," the modeling of student knowledge over time. The goal is to accurately predict how students will perform on future interactions. We had pair our machine learning skills using Riiid’s EdNet data to get an AUC of 0.738 in private leaderboard .
