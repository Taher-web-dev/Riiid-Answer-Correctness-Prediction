# Riiid-Answer-Correctness-Prediction
Kaggle  competition, which challenge us to create algorithms for "Knowledge Tracing," the modeling of student knowledge over time. The goal is to accurately predict how students will perform on future interactions. We had pair our machine learning skills using Riiidâ€™s EdNet data to get an AUC of 0.738 in private leaderboard .

In this repistory , we find three files as follow :

- datas-exploration-and-validate-important-features : In this file we find explorations datas analyses of the differents features and their correlation with target label.
- lgbm_version : In this file we find a first a lgbm modelisation of our problem.
- real-time-features : This file encompase an enhancement version of an lgbm model, who use  new features engineering.
